## Source Version Control 

We are using GitFlow! 
More about it, check it out: https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html
Our definitions for GitFlow:
- our production branch: **main**
- our develop branch: **development**

When the development branch is updated, the application deployed in the cloud is automatically updated:
